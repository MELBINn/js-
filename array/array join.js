// Certainly! After using the `split` method to break the string into an array and the `sort` method to sort the words, you can use the
//  `join` method to concatenate the elements of the array back into a string. Here's an example:

```javascript
let roles = "I am cook and nurse and builder and a father";
let words = roles.split(' ');

// Sorting the words alphabetically in a case-insensitive manner
let sortedWords = words.sort((a, b) => a.toLowerCase().localeCompare(b.toLowerCase()));

// Joining the sorted words into a string
let sortedString = sortedWords.join(' ');

console.log(sortedString);
```

Output:
```
"a am and and builder cook father I nurse"
```

// In this example, the `join` method is used to concatenate the sorted words into a string with spaces between them. This results in a string where the words are sorted alphabetically and separated by spaces.
