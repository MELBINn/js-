// Sure, let me provide a brief explanation of the JavaScript methods used in the examples:

// 1. **`split(separator)`**: This method is used to split a string into an array of substrings. In the examples, it's used to split the paragraph into an array of words based on the space character.

//    ```javascript
//    let words = roles.split(' ');
//    ```

// 2. **`sort()`**: This method is used to sort the elements of an array. In the first example, it's used to alphabetically sort the array of words.

//    ```javascript
//    words.sort();
//    ```

// 3. **`join(separator)`**: This method is used to join the elements of an array into a string. In the sorting example, it's used to join the sorted array of words back into a string.

//    ```javascript
//    let sortedRoles = words.join(' ');
//    ```

// 4. **`forEach(callback)`**: This method is used to iterate over the elements of an array. In the word counting example, it's used to iterate over each word and update the word counts in a `Map`.

//    ```javascript
//    words.forEach(word => {
//        // code to process each word
//    });
//    ```

// 5. **`toLowerCase()`**: This method is used to convert a string to lowercase. In the word counting example, it's used to ensure case-insensitive counting by converting each word to lowercase before updating the counts.

//    ```javascript
//    word = word.toLowerCase();
//    ```

// 6. **`new Map()`**: This is a built-in JavaScript data structure that allows you to store key-value pairs. In the word counting example, it's used to store each word and its corresponding count.

//    ```javascript
//    let wordCounts = new Map();
//    ```

// 7. **`entries()`**: This method is used to get an iterator over the key-value pairs of a `Map`. In the word counting example, it's used to convert the `Map` into an array of entries for printing.

//    ```javascript
//    Array.from(wordCounts.entries())
//    ```

// These methods are part of the JavaScript language and are commonly used for string manipulation, array operations, and data structure management.
